## Usage
You should be able to navigate the UI, but if you can't here is what you do: click on signup, fill out the signup form, log in using your new information(for validation). From there you will be asked to add a habit. Do it. After that, you can update your habit at your leisure.

## Technologies
21 days is built using the MERN tech stack. The API collects data using mongoDB and serves it back through graphQl. The front end is built using react.
